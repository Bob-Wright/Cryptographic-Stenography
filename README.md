# steganografi-kriptografi
This program can encrypt secret messages using a combination of RC4 and base 64 cryptographic algorithms then insert them into image files using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. by combining both cryptographic and steganographic methods, providing multiple security. Encryption will convert a secret message (plain text) into an unreadable random message (cipher text) then inserted into the pixel image with the steganography method (Least significant Bit) so that people do not realize in the image.
