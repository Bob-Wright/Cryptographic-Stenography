# Cryptographic-Stenography
This program can encrypt secret messages using a combination of the RC4 cryptographic algorithm and base 64 encoding, then insert them into image files using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. Combining both cryptographic and steganographic methods provides multiple security. Encryption will convert a secret message (plaintext) into an unreadable random message (ciphertext) then inserted into the pixel image with the steganography method (Least significant Bit).

I thought this was pretty neat code and it has utility for a project, and so I translated the messages and some of the variable names into US English.
